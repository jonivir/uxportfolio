## Usability testing

This extensive usability testing initiative encompassed a total of three distinct tests, each conducted at various stages of the service's development. In each test, both the customer and professional perspectives were tested. In total, the number of test participants were:

- Customers: 6 + 15 + 6
- Professionals: 4 + 12 + 4

The purpose of these usability testing projects was to uncover usability issues in omaolo.fi's core use cases and views through usability testing. Each testing project typically focused on different use cases or views and proposed improvements for them.

Various methods and approaches were employed in usability testing to assess the usability of different aspects, including:

- Paper prototypes
- Interactive prototypes created in Figma
- Testing versions of the web service

Additionally, each testing session included background and post-test surveys for participants. The background survey aimed to gather information about participants' prior experience with the service, while the post-test survey sought to collect user opinions on the tasks performed during testing.

Due to contractual obligations I am unable to disclose any more about these case study publicly.
